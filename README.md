# Python

Hello Everyone! Welcome to my GitHub repo 'Python'.

## Contents of this Repo

In this repo, I will be storing all of my Python projects. The projects are as follows:

### ATM

This program is basically an ATM where you can pay money, withdraw money, and check your balance. When you run the program, you get an `input` to enter the PIN. Enter **1657** (that's the pin). After entering the PIN, you get the options.

### Calculator

This program is a calculator. When you run the program, you get 7 options (add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulus, exponenciation, and floor division). You can choose which operation you want to do and enter the 2 numbers.

### Dictionary

This project is just a dictionary app where in if you type a word, it gives you the definition. Even if you enter a wrong word, this program can sometimes correct you in what you actually wanted to say.

The `Data.json` is a file with all the words and definitions. The Python program interacts with the JSON file to get you the meaning of the word.

### Elvvo

Elvvo is an all-in-one traffic solution that changes its traffic lights according to traffic density.

For more information, go to the "Elvvo" folder and you will find more information on it and the complete code.

## Can You Use It?

Yes, you can download this repo and use it for your own purposes.

You have the right to download, modify, and share it to others. One thing that I don't want you to do is to sell this software to anyone.

## Issues & Bugs
